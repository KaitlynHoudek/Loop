<h3>Biography:</h3>
<p>Here's something that's fun. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.

        Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. It's important to me that you're happy. Happy painting, God bless. Son of a gun. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. And maybe, maybe, maybe...
        
        There we go. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Let's get wild today. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.
        
        Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. With practice comes confidence.
        
        And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. We can fix anything. We must be quiet, soft and gentle.
        
        Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Let's do that again.
        
        I like to beat the brush. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Poor old tree. A happy cloud. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.
        </p>


<h3>Work Experience:</h3>
<p>We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Zip. That easy. See there how easy that is. This piece of canvas is your world. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world.

        Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Trees grow however makes them happy. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.
        
        All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. Brown is such a nice color.
        
        Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Let's build an almighty mountain. We need a shadow side and a highlight side.
        
        Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Don't fight it, use what happens. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.
        
        The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. There comes a nice little fluffer. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun In this world, everything can be happy. Let that brush dance around there and play. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.
        
        Let your imagination be your guide. At home you have unlimited time. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.
